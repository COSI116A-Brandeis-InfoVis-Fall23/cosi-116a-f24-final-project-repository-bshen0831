This project attempts to visualize the differences in demographics for MBTA riders and the population in Boston's neighborhoods. 

If the visualizations are not level or are too big, zoom out until they are.

There is an error "Uncaught ReferenceError: DOCS_timing is not defined" but it has little bearing on the actual functionality as it is due to the embedded Google Doc. The instructions on embedding the Google Doc were followed and the error still occurs. It appears it is from google's side but it still shows up as an error.
